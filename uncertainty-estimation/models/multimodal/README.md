The Multimodal Melbourne Airbnb Price regression model was built following the instructions:
https://github.com/georgian-io/Multimodal-Toolkit
$ python main.py ./datasets/Melbourne_Airbnb_Open_Data/train_config.json

The main.py and the train_config.json from the repository were modified to generate the prediction column in the csv files in the /data/multimodal directory using the generated model.
