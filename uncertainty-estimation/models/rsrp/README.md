The DTU-RSRP models were built following the instructions:
https://github.com/jakthra/PathLossPredictionSatelliteImages

which include the data via Dataport:
https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/mobile-communication-system-measurements-and-satellite-images


The models generated are here for reference: ./full-model and ./image-only 

The predict.py from the repository was modified to generate the prediction column in the csv files in the cp_mm_targ_strg/data/rrsp directory using the models.
